Published in *Ecology* as a Scientific Naturalist article.

**Reference:** Kim, CJS & Kelley. (in press). Pyrosome, *Pyrosoma atlanticum*: highlighting plankton as an important food source for coral reefs in Timor-Leste. *Ecology*. doi: XXXX.

Blooms of *Pyrosoma atlanticum* were observed in late 2019 in Timor-Leste at two sites. Data on the occurence of pyrosomes globally was searched in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility using the *P. atlanticum* taxonkey. The data search can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.vv3adq).

Chlorophyll-a data (Global Ocean Colour, Bio-Geo-Chemical, L3 daily product) was downloaded from the E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (CMEMS) Marine Data Store (MDS). doi: 10.48670/moi-00278.

Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), a measure of El Nino Southern Oscillation, was downloaded from the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration [Climate Prediction Center](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/soi).

# Directions

The code provided the in scripts creates Figures 2 and 3 from the main text; Appendix S1 Figure S1; and the full Appendix S2 document as an MS Word document. The Word document was exported as a pdf for the final publication.

Download or clone the repository locally and open the `.Rproj` file. Create a `figures` directory in the project where the figures will be written too.

In the `scripts` directory, run:

-   Figure 2-map.R
-   Figure 3-chl.R
-   AppendixS1-FigS1-histogram.R

In the `appendixS2` directory, open:

-   AppendixS2-full.qmd

This file requires both **R** and **python** to run. The `references.bib` file contains the references formatted in APA style as in `apa.csl`. The `appendix-reference-doc.docx` is the MS Word template for the formatting of the output `.docx` file. To generate the Word document the `.qmd` file must be rendered instead of `Run`. Can click the `Render` button at the top of the script or `Ctrl + Shift + K` on Windows OS.

Note: The scripts use the native R pipe which will require R v4.0 or greater.
